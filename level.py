Function update(character, level):
    Call getInput() method to handle user input
    Move the character's position horizontally by adding the x component of the direction vector to its current x-coordinate
    Move the character's position vertically by adding the y component of the direction vector to its current y-coordinate
    Apply gravity to the character's vertical motion using applyGravity() method
    If the character is not currently standing on a platform:
        Increase the vertical speed (y component of the direction) by the force of gravity
    Retrieve all tiles in the level
    If the character collides with any of the tiles:
        Set the flag indicating that the character is standing on a platform to True
        Reset the vertical speed (y component of the direction) to zero
